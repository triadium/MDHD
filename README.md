About a year ago, I was interviewed in the company Playrix and to complete the test task received their simplified game engine

At that time, I made a simple game (shooting range) in which the player could not even die, and the only problem for the player was countdown timer. My candidacy was rejected by Playrix for some reason, but I liked their simple game engine. It is so "homely".

When I received an invitation to Jam, I asked my son (13 yo) to draw the necessary graphic material for me and over the several weekends I extended the code base and added more types of enemies to the game, [SG]FX, added the ability of the playerâ€™s gun to be destroyed, and game - things are brighter.

Everything is coded in C++. I have not used lua scripts, I just like to make all the mechanics in C++.

That are

* Composite objects with views, decors, colliders
* Process Processors and Scenes
* Simple physics engine
* Calculation of views and colliders using the graphics library

We used for production: 

* Visual Studio 2017
* Krita 3.3
* Inkscape 0.92.2
* Audacity
* freesound.org
* Playrix Simple Game Engine & Effect Editor
