About a year ago, I was interviewed in the company Playrix and to complete the test task received their simplified game engine

At that time, I made a simple game (shooting range) in which the player could not even die, and the only problem for the player was countdown timer.

When I received an invitation to Jam, I asked my son to draw the necessary graphic material for me and over the several weekend I extended the code base and added more types of enemies to the game, added the ability of the playerâ€™s gun to be destroyed, and game - things are brighter.

Everything is encoded in C ++. I have not used lua scripts, I just like to make all the mechanics in C ++.

That are

* Composite objects with views, decors, colliders
* Process Processors and Scenes
* Simple physics engine
* Calculation of views and colliders using the graphics library
